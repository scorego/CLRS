# The Role of Algorithms in Computing

## Concepts

### What is an algorithm?

Informally, an algorithm is any well-deûned computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output in a finite amount of time.

An algorithm for a computational problem is correct if, for every problem instance provided as input, it halts -- fnishes its computing in finite time -- and outputs the correct solution to the problem instance.

 An incorrect algorithm might not halt at all on some input instances, or it might halt with an incorrect answer. Incorrect algorithms can sometimes be useful, if you can control their error rate.


### What is a data structure?
 A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modiûcations.
